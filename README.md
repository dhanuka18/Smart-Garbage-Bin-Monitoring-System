# Smart-Garbage-Bin-Monitoring-System

ðŸ“¦ Smart Garbage Bin Monitoring System
An IoT-powered waste management system that enables efficient and hygienic waste collection by monitoring bin levels, detecting odors, and automating lid operation. This system is designed to enhance urban cleanliness and support smart city initiatives.

ðŸ“‘ Project Overview
The Smart Garbage Bin Monitoring System addresses critical issues in urban waste management such as overflowing bins, inefficient collection schedules, and unsanitary manual interaction. It combines smart sensors, wireless communication, and automation to streamline waste handling and improve public health.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Real-Time Monitoring of garbage fill levels using ultrasonic sensors
Hands-Free Operation with servo motor-based auto-lid system
Odor Detection using MQ135 gas sensors for air quality alerts
GPS Tracking for efficient route planning and bin location
Wireless Communication using ESP32 for remote alerts
Buzzer Notifications to signal critical waste bin conditions

ðŸ”§ Hardware Components
